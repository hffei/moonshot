[Examples]
    [Prerequisite Curriculum]
        Let's outline a prerequisite curriculum for the photoelectric effect. Remember, this curriculum will lead up to the photoelectric effect (0.1 to 0.9) but not include the topic itself (1.0):

        0.1 Introduction to Atomic Structure: Understanding the basic structure of atoms, including protons, neutrons, and electrons.

        0.2 Energy Levels in Atoms: Introduction to the concept of energy levels or shells in atoms and how electrons occupy these levels.

        0.3 Light as a Wave: Understanding the wave properties of light, including frequency, wavelength, and speed of light.

        0.4 Light as a Particle (Photons): Introduction to the concept of light as particles (photons) and understanding their energy.

        0.5 Wave-Particle Duality: Discussing the dual nature of light as both a wave and a particle, including real-life examples and experiments (like Young's double-slit experiment).

        0.6 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Brief overview of quantum mechanics, including concepts such as quantization of energy and the uncertainty principle.

        0.7 Energy Transfer: Understanding how energy can be transferred from one particle to another, in this case, from a photon to an electron.

        0.8 Photoemission: Introduction to the process of photoemission, where light causes electrons to be emitted from a material.

        0.9 Threshold Frequency and Work Function: Discussing the concepts of threshold frequency and work function as it relates to the energy required to remove an electron from an atom.

    [Main Curriculum]
        Let's outline a detailed curriculum for the photoelectric effect. We'll start from 1.1:

        1.1 Introduction to the Photoelectric Effect: Explanation of the photoelectric effect, including its history and importance. Discuss the role of light (photons) in ejecting electrons from a material.

        1.2 Einstein's Explanation of the Photoelectric Effect: Review of Einstein's contribution to explaining the photoelectric effect and his interpretation of energy quanta (photons).

        1.3 Concept of Work Function: Deep dive into the concept of work function, the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from a material, and how it varies for different materials.

        1.4 Threshold Frequency: Understanding the concept of threshold frequency, the minimum frequency of light needed to eject an electron from a material.

        1.5 Energy of Ejected Electrons (Kinetic Energy): Discuss how to calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons using Einstein's photoelectric equation.

        1.6 Intensity vs. Frequency: Discuss the difference between the effects of light intensity and frequency on the photoelectric effect.

        1.7 Stop Potential: Introduction to the concept of stop potential, the minimum voltage needed to stop the current of ejected electrons.

        1.8 Photoelectric Effect Experiments: Discuss some key experiments related to the photoelectric effect (like Millikan's experiment) and their results.

        1.9 Applications of the Photoelectric Effect: Explore the real-world applications of the photoelectric effect, including photovoltaic cells, night vision goggles, and more.

        1.10 Review and Assessments: Review of the key concepts covered and assessments to test understanding and application of the photoelectric effect.
